Question 5.1: 
Why do we use async/await syntax for API calls instead of callback functions or .then() chains? What are the advantages?
Readability: async/await makes asynchronous code look and behave more like synchronous code, which is easier to read and understand, especially for complex workflows.
Error Handling: With async/await, you can use try/catch blocks for error handling, which is more intuitive and cleaner than chaining .catch() in promise chains.
Avoiding Callback Hell: It eliminates deeply nested callback structures, making the code less prone to errors and easier to maintain.
Debugging: Debugging is simpler because stack traces are more straightforward compared to promise chains or callbacks.



Question 5.2: 
What is the purpose of the finally block in the fetchWeatherData function?
The finally block is used to execute code that should 
run regardless of whether the try block succeeds 
or the catch block handles an error. In the context of fetchWeatherData,
it is typically used to clean up resources or update the UI 
(e.g., hiding a loading spinner) 
to ensure that certain actions are performed no matter the outcome of the API call.
